In the year 2000 the Toowong History Group was formed to celebrate the 100^th^ anniversary of the short-lived Toowong Town (1903-1925). The Group wanted to record local memories before they were lost, and surface more historical stories. It resulted in the production of our first book:


## Toowong: A Community’s History

Toowong: A Community’s History was launched in 2003 to coincide with, and celebrate, the Centenary of Toowong.
