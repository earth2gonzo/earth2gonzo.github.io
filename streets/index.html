He was from a little village called Oestrich on the Rhine near Rudesheim in Hessen. Martin died in a house in Depper Street in 1914. His father Michael grew grapes in Patrick’s Lane in Toowong-supposed to be the first to do so in Brisbane , but he in c.1876 left Brisbane and travelled down to NSW and then back to Germany. The Deppers in QLD phone book are all related and descend from Martin and Michael. Martin despite not being able to speak English in 1863 worked hard to establish himself and later became the manager of the Queensland Deposit Bank. Martin Depper in the Queenslander newspaper 15 Sept 1883 is refusing to give land for road purposes through portion 9 Indooroopilly. The street was named Depper Street in St Lucia – 1891.

The correct name of the sports ground explains the origin of UnionStreet which runs beside it. It was usually called simply the Toowong Sports Ground by local residents. By the early 1940s the simpler name appeared in official maps and documentation and has remained; although the name Oakman Park, which dates from the 1960s and applies only to half the park, has largely obliterated the old name from general usage.</td>

Perry, Charles, 1926, 'A Son of Australia' "moved to the then sparsely populated and exclusive suburb of Toowong" "close by his lifetime friend Henry Stuart of Stuartholme" Henry Stuart was godfather of her father. The book says he lived in the house for a short period when the subdivision of the <strong><a href="../maps/#ascog-estate-1889">Ascog House estate</a></strong> was taking place. The street was named in his honour. His granddaughter is unsure of how long or when he lived in the house but guesses it was during the 1880's. Her father born in 1874, remembered living in the house. They built a very substantial home at Kedron which is now centred in a retirement community.</td>

Stanley later moved to the Kensington Terrace Area. Ormlie became known as Easton Grey when it was owned by the squatter-politician Sir Arthur Hunter Palmer, premier of Queensland 1870-74. The Easton Grey estate was sub-divided in the late 1880s (Easton Grey Estate plan, JOL). It seems most likely that Stanley Terrace was named for FDG Stanley and not for his brother, Henry Charles Stanley, the railways engineer, who lived further west in Toowong before moving to Tighnabruaich in Indooroopilly in the early 1890s.</td>

In the Queensland Post Office Directories from 1892 - 1897 the Wool family is living at Church Street Toowong although there is an earlier entry in 1888 at Maryvale Street. In any case the family were fruiterers or involved in the fruit and vegetable trade. At the time of Mary Ann (Cunningtons) death in 1911 they are living at Maryvale Street Toowong which is quite close to Wool St. We don't know when Wool Street came into being but we assume it was named for John Lover and/or wife Mary Ann. Mary Ann seems to have been quite a formidable woman and in her will it lists two properties owned by herself. John Lover Wool and wife Mary Ann are buried in the Toowong Cemetery as are many of their nine children.</td>
